# Library Management System

This is a Library Management System application that is built with Spring Boot which has a MySQL database and uses RabbitMQ. 

The application allows the user to create/save, update, delete and view books, book properties (genre, format), authors,  users and rooms. It automatically generates tasks which can be queried for status updates when an attempt to borrow a book is made. Admin and user roles have different levels of access in the application.
